Parameters to adjust values used in visualizations.

- Minimum Wage
- Months of Service Limit



## Minimum Wage Impact Bar Charts
- Dual bar charts that show the dollar impact and the headcount of employees affected by an increased minimum wage broken down by department.



~~~sql 

### SET: Hourly Wage < Minimum Wage
// T/F: Checks if the hourly wage is less than  the company min wage param

SUM([Hourly Wage]) < [Minimum Wage]



### SET: MoS >= MoS Limit
// T/F: Checks if employee months of service (MoS) is greater than or equal to months of service param.

SUM([Months Of Service]) >= [Months of Service Limit]



### COMBO SET: Wage-MoS Combo Set
MoS >= MoS Limit & Hourly Wage < Minimum Wage



### !Hourly Cost: Wage Before Increase

// Calculates total hourly wages of employees earning less than company minimum wage param.

// If emp_id is in set
IF MIN([Hourly Wage < Minimum Wage])

// Take the sum of each hourly wage multiplied by the number of employees who make that wage.
THEN SUM([Hourly Wage] * {FIXED [Emp Id]:COUNT([Hourly Wage])})

// Else return NULL
ELSE NULL
END



### !Hourly Cost: Wage After Increase

// Calculates total hourly wages of employees currently earning less than company minimum wage param if their wage was increased to the company minimum wage param.

// If emp_id is in set
IF MIN([Hourly Wage < Minimum Wage])

// Take the sum of company minimum wage param multiplied by the number of employees who currently have an hourly wage less than the company minimum wage param.
THEN SUM([Minimum Wage]*{FIXED [Emp Id]:COUNT([Hourly Wage])})

// Else return NULL
ELSE NULL
END



### !Yearly Additional Cost After Increase

// Calculates total yearly additional wages to be earned by employees currently earning less than minimum wage param if minimum was increased to match the param.

(([!Hourly Cost: Wage After Increase]-[!Hourly Cost: Wage Before Increase])*40)*52
