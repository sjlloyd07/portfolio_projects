### Preparation
The data consists of internal Cyclistic user transaction records that have had all identifying factors removed.  The datasets being used consist of monthly transaction records in the form of 13 .csv files from the months of March 2022 to March 2023 that were downloaded to local storage from the [host website](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) using a python script found [here](capstone_scrape.py).  Each data file was then unzipped and consolidated into one folder.  One at a time, each .csv file was loaded into Excel with Power Query for initial evaluation. 

Each .csv file contained raw data stored in 13 fields formatted below as detected by Power Query: 
| ride_id | rideable_type	| started_at | ended_at	| start_station_name	| start_station_id	|end_station_name	| end_station_id	| start_lat	| start_lng	| end_lat	| end_lng	| member_casual |
| --- | ---	| --- | ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| --- |
| *text* | *text*	| *datetime* | *datetime*	| *text*	| *text*	| *text*	| *text*	| *decimal number*	| *decimal number*	| *decimal number*	| *decimal number*	| *decimal text* |

The field ***ride_id*** contains unique values and is the primary key of each dataset.

The data was transormed in Power Query to filter out the following fields that contained values irrelevant for this analysis: 
| start_station_id	| end_station_id	| start_lat	| start_lng	| end_lat	| end_lng	|
| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| --- | --- |

The remaining data fields below were then ready for further cleaning and manipulation.
| ride_id | rideable_type	| started_at | ended_at	| start_station_name	| end_station_name	| member_casual |
| --- | ---	| --- | ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	|

The data is:
- **reliable** - consists of records from the total population that were taken using unbiased methods (non-identifying timestamped transactions)
- **original** - comes from internal Cyclistic sources
- **comprehensive** - data contains all relevant metrics required for intended analysis focused on product use comparison between two variables (casual users/members) over a period of time
- **current** - up-to-date to the month previous to the beginning of this analysis
- **cited** - acquired using internally defined, trustworthy methods of collection
