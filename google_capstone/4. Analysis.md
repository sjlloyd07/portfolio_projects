# Analysis

Power Query was used to consolidate the data into a pivot table.  The analysis was focused on the Cyclistic ride user status recorded in the *member_casual* column of which the variable could be one of two values - *member* or *casual*. Analysis was performed on the final dataset that contained **6,087,365** records that were taken between **March 2022** and **March 2023**.

## Frequency
Cyclistic members (member) took 20% more rides over the time period than Cyclistic casual riders (casual).

Members took more rides than casual riders in every month of the year.  Rides taken by both groups followed a similar trend over the year - the fewest number of rides were taken during the winter months and increased gradually through the spring until peaking in the summer months.  The smallest difference between total rides of both groups was in July - less than 2%, and the greatest difference - almost 60% - was in January.

Members and casual riders had the least difference in total rides taken over the weekend - less than 2% - and Sunday is the only day of the week that casual riders had more rides than members.  Throughout the week, rides taken by both groups had an inverse relationship with member rides increasing and peaking in the middle of the week and casual rides declining to the lowest levels during the same time period.

Members and casual riders followed a slightly different trend in an average 24 hour day.  Casual rider total rides increased gradually through the morning hours and peaked at 5 pm.  Member rides also peaked at 5 pm, but a ride spike was also observed at 8 am before dropping and increasing again in the afternoon.

For every month of the year, the casual rider average ride length (in minutes) was more than double the member average ride length.

Member rides were evenly split between electric and classic bikes, while casual rides had a slight preference for electric bikes.

Of the over 6 million records in the dataset, 5.2 million records had geographic location data that was analyzed for the purpose of comparison between the members and casual riders.  A list containing the top 10 station names sorted greatest to least by total rides taken from each departure station was compiled for each group.  The lists had one station commonality.
