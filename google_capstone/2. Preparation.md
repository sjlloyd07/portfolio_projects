# Preparation
### Data Source
The data was sourced from an anonymous, real world bike share company that will be analyzed as Cyclistic records for this analysis and consists of internal user transaction records that have had all user identifying factors removed.  The datasets are monthly transaction records in the form of 13 `.csv` files from the months of **March 2022 to March 2023** that were downloaded to local storage from the [host website](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) using a python script found [here](capstone_scrape.py). Each data file was then unzipped and consolidated into one folder.  One at a time, each `.csv` file was loaded into Microsoft Excel with Power Query for initial evaluation. 

<br>

Each `.csv` file contained raw data stored in 13 fields formatted below as detected by Power Query: 

| ride_id | rideable_type	| started_at | ended_at	| start_station_name	| start_station_id	|end_station_name	| end_station_id	| start_lat	| start_lng	| end_lat	| end_lng	| member_casual |
| --- | ---	| --- | ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| --- |
| *text* | *text*	| *datetime* | *datetime*	| *text*	| *text*	| *text*	| *text*	| *decimal number*	| *decimal number*	| *decimal number*	| *decimal number*	| *decimal text* |

The `ride_id` field contains unique values and is the primary key of each dataset as defined by the data source.

<br>

The data was transormed in Power Query to filter out the following fields that contained values irrelevant for this analysis: 
| start_station_id	| end_station_id	| start_lat	| start_lng	| end_lat	| end_lng	|
| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| --- | --- |

<br>

The remaining data fields below were then ready for further cleaning and manipulation.
| ride_id | rideable_type	| started_at | ended_at	| start_station_name	| end_station_name	| member_casual |
| --- | ---	| --- | ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	|

<br>

### Data Integrity:
- **reliable** - consists of records from the total population that were taken using unbiased methods (non-identifying timestamped transactions)
- **original** - comes from internal sources
- **comprehensive** - data contains all relevant metrics required for intended analysis focused on product use comparison between two variables (casual users/members) over a period of time
- **current** - up-to-date to the month previous to the beginning of this analysis
- **cited** - acquired using internally defined, trustworthy methods of collection
