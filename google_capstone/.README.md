## Case Study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

Cyclistic is a bike share company based in Chicago, Illinois.  The Cyclistic executive team wants to increase rider membership by forming a marketing strategy targeting casual users of their products and convincing them to become paid members.  The purpose of this case study was to show how riders used the products over the past year in order for the marketing team to design an effective strategy.  Over 6 million Cyclistic ride records were collected over the year, and anlaysis showed that while Cyclist member and casual rider total use trends similarly over the year with the seasons, there are significant differences with how the two groups use Cyclistic products on a daily basis, such as the day of week each group more actively uses the products, for how long, and where.
